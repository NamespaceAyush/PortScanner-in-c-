# PortScanner-in-c-
This is the simple Port Scanner that i have created few Months back
This is my first repo to git hub ---->many more to come
lets come back to the project 
there are only two files one the cpp source file and second the Makefile for make
both of this files are in master branch(still trying to learn git tool )
_______________________________________-DEPENDENCES-________________
make sure you have SFML Library installed and yes please don't rely on your package manager go to SFML official website and download it from there and then
build it from cMake i am pretty sure this will install all the dependencies which is needed for this small project .if your copying .so files manually then
you have to add the install path in the Makefile 
to compile this project just run the make command
As of todays date the code is working fine in linux debian 10
although I am pretty sure it won't work with windows so please don't try to execute on any platform other than linux
