# PortScanner-in-c-
This is my first repo to git hub ---->many more to come

This is the simple Port Scanner which will tell you which port is open or closed on your or website or also on 127.0.0.1 i.e on your local machine 
but before scanning port of any website make sure they have given permission to scan the port on your website because in many countries it is ILLEGAL
to scan the port of someone else machine.

IM AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYTHING BAD HAPPEN WITH YOU OR YOUR MACHINE BECAUSE OF MY CODE

also you are free to stick the code where ever you want


______________________________________-USAGE-___________________________________________

compile it and execute it 

it will ask for address you can simply enter localhost or if you really wan to scan for a network just use this website http://scanme.nmap.org/ every one is
authorized to scan this website for open ports
now after pressing enter it will ask for port you want to check you can specify a single port or also the range of port like 0-100




there are only two files one the cpp source file and second the Makefile for make

both of this files are in master branch(still trying to learn git tool )




_______________________________________-DEPENDENCES-________________

make sure you have SFML Library installed and yes please don't rely on your package manager go to SFML official website and download it from there and then
build it from cMake i am pretty sure this will install all the dependencies which is needed for this small project .if your copying .so files manually then
you have to add the install path in the Makefile to compile this project just run the make command

As of todays date the code is working fine in linux debian 10

although I am pretty sure it won't work with windows so please don't try to execute on any platform other than linux
